# string_util

This repository contains different functions that add animation to the string printing.<br>

**MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH TERMINAL LENGTH TO INCLUDE FULL STRING**<br>

otherwise, you will see something strange ;(<br>
If you have any other idea, please do push request so that I can include.<br>
